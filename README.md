# Pokefinder
A checklist of Pokemon locations in Sun and Moon!

Pokefinder shows a list of locations by route that Pokemon can be found. It saves locally to your computer, and checks off duplicate Pokemon.

You can use it as a Pokedex to check of Pokemon you have caught on certain routes, or as a route guide to find where to catch the Pokemon you next want to find.

## Features:
* Pokemon sorted by route and location, so you can find them easily
* Automatic selection of duplicate Pokemon that you have already selected, so you won't go hunting for Pokemon you already have
* Local save, so you can always load up the previous state of your checklist when you left the page
* Links to each route section, so you can easily navigate them
* And more!

The project uses [Pokesprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite) for the Pokemon sprites.
