# Pokefinder
A checklist of Pokemon locations in Sun and Moon!

Pokefinder shows a list of locations by route that Pokemon can be found. It saves locally to your computer, and checks off duplicate Pokemon.

## Features:
* Every Pokemon from every route
* Automatic selection of duplicate Pokemon that you have already selected
* Local save
* Links to each route section
* And more!

The project uses [Pokesprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite) for the Pokemon sprites.
