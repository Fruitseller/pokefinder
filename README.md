**Project delayed due to [issues with Pokesprite and jQuery](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/pokefinder/issues/2)**

# Pokefinder
A checklist of Pokemon locations in Sun and Moon!

Pokefinder shows a list of locations by route that Pokemon can be found. It saves locally to your disk.

The project uses [Pokesprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite) for the Pokemon sprites.
